<p>Ensure that your first dive is made in conditions that are suitable for learning.</p> 
 
<h3>The following conditions are ideal for diving.</h3> 

<ul> 
  <li>Slow water current</li>
  <li>Low wind speed</li>
  <li>Clear water</li>
  <li>No obstructions above or below the surface</li>
  </ul>
 
<p>While the VideoRay Explorer can be used in less than optimal conditions, which include some environmentally
extreme conditions, ensure that operation is only attempted in such conditions after acquiring experience with the scout. If the conditions are too hazardous, postpone the dive and find a more suitable dive location. Operate the VideoRay Explorer within close range until a level of experience and comfort with the product has been attained.</p> 

<h3>Launching the Explorer</h3> 

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Be certain that the tether connectors are securely connected and screwed together to avoid separation and loss of the Explorer ROV.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Power up the VideoRay Explorer.<p></p></li>

  <li>The tether should be neatly coiled and made ready to deploy. It must be free of tangles, knots, and other obstructions.<p></p></li>

  <li>Inform swimmers, divers, boaters and others in the area that you are about to deploy the VideoRay Explorer with a tether, that will be in the water as well.<p></p></li>

  <li>Avoid dropping or throwing the Explorer into the water. Rather, use the tether to lower the Explorer to the water surface. This method will prevent the impact of the Explorer with the pier or vessel from which you are launching.<p></p></li> 
  </ol>
