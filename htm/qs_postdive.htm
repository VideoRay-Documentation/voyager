<p>Make sure to clean and rinse all equipment in fresh water after use. Allow the components to dry before storage.</p>

<h3>Retrieving the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--></h3>

<ol>
  
  <li>Ensure the tether is free from obstacles on which it may become caught or entangled in
the water.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Navigate the VideoRay <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> to a retrieval area where the water surface is clear of
obstructions.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Power down the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> by switching off the main power supply.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Retrieve the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> by pulling it out of the water by its tether. Care should be taken to coil the tether properly and avoid collisions between the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> and the pier or boat hull.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Once the ROV is retrieved, perform a Post-Dive Inspection as described below.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Post-Dive Inspection</h3>

<p>Carry out a post-dive inspection after every dive.</p>

<ol>

  <li>Make sure the power is off.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Unplug the connections.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Return the video display monitor to its storage position by loosening the locking knob and rotating the monitor so the screen faces toward the inside of the cover and away from you.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>The vehicle should be visually inspected following each dive to ensure that no
mechanical damage has occurred.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Visually check through the ports to ensure that no water has entered the pressure housings.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Check that the propeller shafts have not been fouled with material such as fishing line,
string, seaweed, or other debris.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>If the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> has been used in salt water, thoroughly rinse the vehicle with fresh
water prior to being stored away.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Inspect the tether for cuts, nicks and / or kinks in the outer shell. Store the tether
properly for the next use.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Store all components securely.</li>
