<h1>Maintenance Guide</h1>

<p>The tool kit provided with the VideoRay <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> includes all tools necessary for VideoRay
maintenance.</p> 

<h3>Cleaning the VideoRay <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--></h3> 

<ul>

  <li>Always unplug the system from the power source before cleaning.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Do not use liquid or aerosol cleaners on the system control box and power supply. Use a damp cloth for cleaning.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Disconnect the power before attempting to clear fouled propellers.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>After use in salt water or chemical solutions, thoroughly rinse the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> with fresh water before storing.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>For general cleaning of the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2-->, use a mild detergent.<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Internal Moisture Detection</h3>

<p>A moisture sensitive color-changing desiccant pack is included in the main hull and is visible through the rear dome. In dry conditions, this desiccant pack is blue. If moisture is present, the desiccant pack will turn pink. If the desiccant pack is pink, do not use the system until the moisture is removed and the cause of the moisture determined and corrected.</p>

<h3>Mechanical Servicing Precautions</h3>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Disconnect the system power and vehicle tether before
commencing any maintenance or repairs.</p>

<p>Sealed components are designed to be tight fitting. Be gentle when opening them. Forcing a component open or closed may damage it permanently. Do not use metal tools to pry open sealed parts. Many VideoRay components are anodized aluminum and will be damaged by contact with steel. If components do not come apart with bare hands or "soft" tools, check to ensure that all fasteners have been removed.</p>


<h3>Caring for Seals and O-Rings</h3>

<p>VideoRay recommends the use of Dow Corning #4 Silicon Grease, as a lubricant for O-rings used as seals. Other lubricants can lead to deterioration and failure of the O-rings
and components.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Do not use any lubricants other than the
recommended lubricant.</p>

<h3>O-Ring Rule of Thumb</h3>

<p>Compared to the equipment they are protecting, O-rings are very inexpensive. Should an incorrectly sized or damaged O-ring be installed, the result can be very detrimental. If there is any doubt as to the suitability or condition of an O-ring it should be replaced.</p>

<h3>Inspection</h3>

<p>O-rings wear out over time. Inspect all O-rings whenever a sealed assembly is apart. "Healthy" O-rings are soft, flexible and have not been pinched or nicked. Should an O-ring appear brittle, or have apparent cracks, nicks, or evidence of being pinched or permanently compressed, it will require replacement. Sealing surfaces should also be inspected while an assembly is apart. Examine surfaces to determine that they are free of dirt, nicks, scratches, or damage, which may result in seal failure once reassembled.</p>

<h3>Care and Storage</h3>

<p>Store O-Rings in clean plastic bags to protect them from dust when not in use. Avoid prolonged storage in direct sunlight as this may result in deterioration of the O-ring material. Sort stored O-rings with regard to type and size, have that information noted on the storage bag. Use of an incorrect O-ring can result in an ineffective seal.</p>

<h3>Handling Sealed Components</h3>

<p>Don't handle O-rings and other components that have sealing surfaces with dirty or gritty hands. A small amount of dirt trapped next to an O-ring can cause leakage, which could result in serious damage to the equipment the O-rings are intended to protect. Should an O-ring or sealing surface become dirty, wash it with mild soap and water, and then rinse it with clean water. Avoid scratching the surfaces of O-rings and the components that contact them. Do not use sharp objects such as a knife or screwdriver to pry apart sealed assemblies or remove O-rings. Serious damage to the O-ring or the seat may result. When components require storage with the sealing surfaces exposed, they should be stored in a clean, dry location for protection.</p>

<h3>Servicing the Lights</h3>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Caution! The Light Bulb may be very hot.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Do not handle new bulbs with bare fingers. Oils and acids from hands and fingers can affect the bulb and result in shortened operating life. Protect the bulb with a paper towel or a clean cloth during handling.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Open the light housing by carefully unscrewing the light dome. Using a clean rag, grasp the light bulb and pull it from its socket.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Insert the replacement bulb and reassemble the light housing, making sure all O-rings are properly installed and seated.<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Horizontal Propeller Removal / Replacement</h3>	

<!--1-->
<ul>
  <li><p>Using the 7/16" wrench, loosen, but do not remove the propeller nut </p></li>
  <li><p>Pull the propeller from the shaft.  If it does not come off easily, loosen the nut more, and tap on the nut toward the thruster motor with the wrench.</p></li>
  <li><p></p></li> 
  <li>Replacement is accomplished by reversing this process.<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> The horizontal propellers are counter rotating.  Make sure to replace the propellers on the correct shafts.  When viewed from behind, the top blade of the port (left) propeller curves to the right, and the top blade of the starboard (right) propeller will curve to the left.</p>
<!--/1-->

<!--2-->
<ul>
  <li>Remove the thruster guard by unscrewing it from the thruster pod.<p></p></li>
  <li>Following the removal of the appropriate propeller guard, the propeller can be taken off by first loosening the propeller locking nut (use 7mm wrench).<p></p></li>  
  <li>Then remove the propeller by unscrewing it from the shaft.<p></p></li> 
  <li>Replacement is accomplished by reversing this process. Care must be taken to maintain a .75 mm to 1 mm clearance between the propeller locking nut and the seal spacer to prevent jamming.<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Cartridge Seal Inspection and Replacement</h3>

<p>Your VideoRay <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> has been equipped with our cartridge design. This means that the seals that prevent water from entering the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> through the motor shafts can be replaced rapidly and without tools. It also means that you can check for impending seal failure easily. There are two “Bal Seals” on the shaft of each of the three thrusters on a <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2-->. Between these two seals is an oil chamber. The cartridge is constructed of machined acrylic and brass, and contains the two seals and the oil. To change the cartridges, follow the steps below.</p>

<ol>
  
  <li>Remove the nozzle (no tools are needed, just unscrew the nozzle).<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Use a 7mm wrench to hold the propeller nut and unscrew the propeller.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Unscrew the nut and remove the single nylon washer.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Use a screwdriver to gently pry out the seal cartridge.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Place the washer on top of the new seal cartridge and push it onto the shaft and into the cartridge cavity.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Screw on the nut by hand until is tight against the seal, then back it off 2 turns.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Hold the nut with the wrench and tighten the propeller.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Replace the nozzle,check for the presence of water in the oil bath every 10-20 hours
of usage.<p></p></li> 
  
  <li>If there is water in the oil, the cartridge should be replaced within the next 10-20 hours.<p></p></li>
  </ol>
