Carry out a pre-dive check prior to every dive.

<ol>

  <li>Visually inspect the vehicle to ensure that the propellers are free of tangles and that the
vehicle is in operational condition. Check the propeller guards for damage or misalignment.<p></p></li>

  <li>Check the tether for scrapes, nicks or other visible damage.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Ensure that all fasteners are in place and secure.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Ensure that the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> has been properly ballasted for the water conditions in which you plan to dive, and that the ballast is secure. The VideoRay comes from the factory ballasted for fresh water although water properties may vary locally and cause a need for re-ballasting the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2-->.<p></p></li>

  <li>Ensure that all cables are properly connected and the tether connectors are screwed together to avoid separation and loss of the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> ROV.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Power up the system by engaging the Main Power switch to the “On” position. The monitor should automatically power up, but if it does not, there is a power button on the monitor that may need to be pressed.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Using the joystick, displace it in all directions to test the port and starboard thrusters.
  
<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Do not operate the thrusters for more that 20 seconds when the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> ROV is out of the water. Prolonged operation in a dry environment will result in damage to motor shaft seals.</p><p></p></li>
  
  <li>Using the Depth Control knob, rotate it to test the vertical thruster. Return the knob to the neutral position.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Verify that both lights are working by rotating the joystick toward “Bright”, and then returning the knob to the “Dim” position.
  
<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Do not operate the lights for more than 60 seconds when the VideoRay ROV is out of the water. Doing so may cause overheating and damage the unit.</p><p></p></li>
  
  <li> Check the camera and monitor operation. If you are using a VCR, check that the recording and playback functions are operational.<p></p></li>
  
  <li>Power down the system until you are ready to launch the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2-->.<p></p></li>
  </ol>
