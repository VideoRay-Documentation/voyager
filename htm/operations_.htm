<h1>Operations Guide</h1>

<p>Navigation underwater is very different from navigation on land. The largest difference is that the VideoRay <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> operates in three dimensions, rather than two. Below are some tips for maneuvering the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> underwater.</p>

<h3>Tactics</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The submerged operation and navigation of the VideoRay <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> is accomplished by what is commonly referred to as "dead reckoning". This involves the observation and subsequent recognition of landmarks as viewed on your Video Monitor. The compass rose will help you keep track of direction.<p></p></li>
  <li>When operating in areas containing obstructions or obstacles that can potentially snag or foul the tether, the operator should endeavor to remember the route taken to get to any one position. Not only will this information be helpful on the return trip, it will be extremely valuable in the event the tether does become snagged or fouled.<p></p></li>
  <li>In the event obstructions are encountered, and the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2-->'s position becomes lost, always remember that the safest way back is to follow the tether.<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Handling the Tether</h3>
  
<p>The tether feeds power and control signals to the vehicle and returns data from the sensors. If the tether becomes damaged from improper use, poor handling or an accident, the vehicle may become crippled or inoperable. For maximum tether life and reliability, follow the recommended tether handling tips below.If improper tether handling techniques are used the tether may become tangled, which ultimately leads to kinking, trampling underfoot, and other tether damage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Never step on the tether. Trampling the tether underfoot may crush conductors and coax cables, leading to premature failure. Trampling is also abrasive to the tether jacket. Remember, this is a multi-conductor tether, not at electrical extension cord.<p></p></li>
  <li>Never allow a truck, passenger vehicle, or boat to drive over the tether. This will do more concentrated and immediate damage than trampling.</li>
  <li>Do not allow the tether to be deployed over a sharp edge. This could cause a kink, cut or excessive wear.<p></p></li>
  <li>Do not bend the tether beyond its minimum bend diameter. Most tethers have a minimum bend diameter of three to four inches. If the tether is bent beyond this diameter on pulleys or around corners, wire fatigue will be accelerated. For a general rule of thumb, do not bend the tether any tighter than what would fit around a typical soft drink can.</li>
   <li>Never kink the tether. A fully bent back kink causes local but permanent deformation in the tether. This can be serious because accelerated wire fatigue is subsequently concentrated at the kink location. Such a kink may also be severe enough to instantly break any coax cables in the tether.<p></p></li>
  <li>Avoid snap loading the tether. This situation may easily occur when a slack tether is reeled onto a motorized spool. Loads may peak at a very high value when the tether snaps taunt. Another dangerous situation for snap loading is a tethered submersible vehicle operated from a pitching ship.<p></p></li>
  <li>The preferred tether storage and deployment method is to use a VideoRay TDS (Optional system available from VideoRay). For very long tethers, this often becomes the preferred choice.<p></p></li>
  <li>Shorter tethers may be stored and deployed from a box with a removable lid. If the tether is to be deployed from a hanger system, make sure the hanger supports the tether beyond its minimum bend diameter.<p></p></li>
  <li>When coiling the tether in a box, put in the surface connector first so that the vehicle connector is at the top of the coil. Start the coil at least 10 feet away from the surface end of tether. This leaves some free tether from the bottom of the coil to quickly connect to the power supply without unwinding or removing the coil.<p></p></li>
  <li>When deploying the tether, a person should be available to tend the unwinding coils to prevent kinks.<p></p></li>
  <li>When coiling the tether, do not force the tether to twist. Doing so may damage the tether or make it very difficult to manage. When a loop of tether is laid down in a coil, the tether experiences an axial twist. This causes the next loop to preferentially lay in the opposite direction. Thus, any given tether loop will have a self-preferred winding direction – left or right. Both winding directions may be easily accommodated as shown below by allowing the loops to turn under themselves. This creates loops in both coiling directions and any twist in the tether is canceled in the subsequent loop.<p></p></li> 
  <li>Don't feed out unnecessary tether. When flying the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> back along its tether, haul in the slack line to avoid leaving a loop behind the vehicle.<p></p></li>
  <li>Avoid weaving in and around fixed objects like pilings, rocks, and anchors. When operating in possibly fouled areas, it is advisable to remain on the surface until the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> is approximately above your intended dive objective.<p></p></li>
  <li>Do not try to rip a snagged tether free. In the event the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2-->'s tether becomes snagged, maneuver the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> along the tether to determine the location of the snag. If the problem area can be located visually using the vehicle, appropriate corrective action can usually be taken.<p></p></li>
  <li>If the problem area cannot be located using the camera, try pulling gently on the tether. Turn the vehicle power off and pull from different angles and directions if possible.<p></p></li>
 <li>In the event the tether cannot be otherwise freed, it may be necessary to have a diver retrieve it manually. In that circumstance, turn off the system power and unplug it from its power source.<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Ballast Setup</h3>

<p>The <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> is configured at the factory to be neutrally buoyant in fresh water. Depending upon the water conditions, including salinity or other factors, the VideoRay ballast might need to be adjusted for proper operation. Ballast is adjusted by adding or removing weights from the ballast retaining system located under the ROV between the skids. These weights are included with your VideoRay <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2-->. The ballast should be adjusted so a submerged <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> ROV floats upward slightly (positive buoyancy). Should the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> rise rapidly, or the vertical thruster create a fountain spray of water when near the surface, more ballast must be added. Should the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> sink, some ballast must be removed. Salt water density is greater than that of fresh water. Additional ballast must be added to the VideoRay <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> ROV when using it in salt water.</p>
 
<h3>Loss of Thruster Power</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Should the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> suddenly become unresponsive in a particular direction, it is possible that one of the thrusters may have lost power. The most common cause of thruster power loss is a fouled propeller. This often is the result of organic or synthetic material becoming tangled in a propeller and subsequently wrapped tightly around the propeller shaft.<p></p></li>
  <li>The <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2-->'s thrusters are designed to operate at their rated speed for extended periods
of time. However, should a propeller become jammed, the motor may burn out if
power is continually applied. Power should be turned off, and the vehicle retrieved
and inspected. Remove any debris and test the thruster for proper operation. Note
that the guards on the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2--> are specifically designed for rapid and easy removal.<p></p></li>
  <li>If the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2-->'s thrusters are not fouled and still do not run, try resetting the
VideoRay controller by switching the power supply off, waiting ten seconds, and
switching it back on again.<p></p></li>
  <li>Servicing may be necessary if the propeller and shaft are clear and rotate freely, yet
the thruster does not respond to its controls. If the problem persists, contact VideoRay support.<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Fogged View Port or Light Lenses</h3>

<p>Atmospheric conditions may result in some humidity being present inside the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2-->'s
pressure housings. This may cause condensation to form on the camera view port or light lenses. Ordinarily this problem is not serious and may go away over a short period of time. Should it persist, the use of a desiccant such as silica gel, which can be found at most photographic stores or from the <!--1-->Voyager<!--/1--><!--2-->Explorer<!--/2-->, may be placed inside the vehicle's pressure housing.</p>
